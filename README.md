# PyBer_Challenge

#Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The purpose of this project is to perform analysis of Pyber ride sharing to gain data of rider and fare metrics by the types of cities in which Pyber is running. This rideshare data for PyBer is to help improve ride-sharing services.



#Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

by the image above you can see there are big difference in amount of riders from each city type
the urban city provides the most activity 
rural city brings in the most rider fares per rider 
the urban city pays the least to drivers
Suburban shows a median between the rural and urban city drivers pay and riders fare


#Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Based on the analysis my recommendations to Pyber are: increase the amount of drivers in the Rural Area and Suburban areas.onc can indicate that rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with trips.

Whith more drivers theres less loss of business from the rural areas.

Offer incentives to the Urban Drivers to counter the difference in the driver pay in differet areas.
